# Inky-Attic

This is the first game I made with Unity. I got tired of tutorials so I figured making a game would serve as a pretty good tutorial. I don't know why I didn't push this to Github earlier but here it is now.

## About this game

This is a really simple 2D platforming game where you control what I can only describe as a goonish blob holding a flashlight that is attempting to escape an attic filled with other blobby creatures. If you'd care to play, you can download it on itch.io [here](https://unsnughero.itch.io/inky-attic).
