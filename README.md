# Inky-Attic

This is the first game I made with Unity. It is also the first game I made that isn't a Pong clone. I don't know why I didn't push this to Github earlier but here it is now.

## About this game

This is a really simple 2D platforming game where you control what I can only describe as a goonish blob holding a flashlight that is attempting to escape an attic filled with other blobby creatures.
